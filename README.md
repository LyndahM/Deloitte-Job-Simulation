# Daikibo Factory Telemetry and Equality Analysis
## Project Objective
The objective of this project was to analyse telemetry data collected from Daikibo's four factories to determine which location experienced the most machine breakdowns and identify the specific machines that failed most frequently in that location. Additionally, an analysis was conducted to investigate gender pay equality within the company using employee compensation data. This project demonstrates my proficiency in Excel and Tableau by providing data-driven insights and actionable recommendations.
## Project Description
Project Description:
This job simulation involved working with datasets containing telemetry data and employee compensation data from the following Daikibo factories:
•	Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
•	Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
•	Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
•	Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)
Each location had 9 types of machines, each sending a message every 10 minutes over one month (May 2021). The tasks included:
•	Cleaning and transforming the JSON telemetry data.
•	Analyzing factory downtime and identifying the factory with the most breakdowns.
•	Identifying the most frequently failing machine types in the worst-performing location.
•	Analyzing employee compensation data to determine gender pay disparities.
•	Developing interactive dashboards in Tableau for visualization
