# Daikibo Factory Telemetry and Equality Analysis
## Project Objective
The objective of this project was to analyse telemetry data collected from Daikibo's four factories to determine which location experienced the most machine breakdowns and identify the specific machines that failed most frequently in that location. Additionally, an analysis was conducted to investigate gender pay equality within the company using employee compensation data. This project demonstrates my proficiency in Excel and Tableau by providing data-driven insights and actionable recommendations.

## Dataset
- <a href="https://github.com/LyndahM/Deloitte-Job-Simulation/blob/main/daikibo-telemetry-data.json.zip">Daikibo telemetry data</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/LyndahM/Deloitte-Job-Simulation/blob/main/Equality%20Table.xlsx">Equality data</a>

## Key Questions
Which Daikibo factory experienced the most machine breakdowns?
What were the most frequently failing machine types in that location?
How do pay equality scores vary across different job roles and factory locations?

#Tools Used:

Excel: Data cleaning, transformation, calculations, and categorization.
